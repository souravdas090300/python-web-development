**Date:** October 14-16, 2025  
**Student:** Sourav Das  
**Exercise:** 1.1 - Python Environment Setup  
**Updated:** October 16, 2025 - Implemented pure `uv` workflow per mentor recommendation

---

## üìù What I Did

### 1. Python Installation
- **Installed Python 3.14.0** (newer than the required 3.8.7)
- Verified installation using `python --version`
- Added Python to Windows PATH during installation
- Chose the latest stable version to take advantage of new features and improvements

### 2. Virtual Environment Setup with Pure `uv` Workflow
- **Discovered and installed `uv`** - A modern, fast Python package installer (10-100x faster than pip)
- **Initialized project with `uv init --bare`**
  - Created `pyproject.toml` file automatically
  - Modern dependency management (replaces requirements.txt)
- **Created first virtual environment:** `cf-python-base`
  - Command: `uv venv cf-python-base`
  - Activated with: `.\cf-python-base\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
- **Created second virtual environment:** `cf-python-copy`
  - Duplicated from pyproject.toml to practice environment replication
  - Command: `uv venv cf-python-copy`

### 3. Package Installation with `uv add`
- **Installed IPython 9.6.0** using pure uv workflow
  - Command: `uv add ipython` (NOT `uv pip install ipython`)
  - Auto-created `.venv` folder
  - Auto-updated `pyproject.toml` with dependency
  - Verified by launching IPython shell
- **Installed bcrypt 5.0.0** with same approach
  - Command: `uv add bcrypt`
  - Automatically added to `pyproject.toml`
- Total of **16 packages** installed (including dependencies)

### 4. Modern Dependency Management with `pyproject.toml`
- **pyproject.toml auto-created** by `uv init --bare`
  - No manual editing needed
  - Auto-updated by `uv add` commands
  - More informative than requirements.txt
- **Installed packages in second environment** from pyproject.toml
  - Command: `uv pip install -r pyproject.toml`
  - Verified both environments have identical packages
- **No pip freeze needed!** ‚Äî Dependencies tracked automatically

### 5. Python Script Development
- **Created `add.py`** - Simple addition script following mentor specifications:
  - Prompts user for two integers
  - Stores in variables `a` and `b`
  - Calculates sum in variable `c`
  - Prints result to console
- **Created `test_run.py`** - Simplified test file (per mentor recommendation)
  - Uses direct import instead of importlib
  - Tests multiple input scenarios
  - Clean, maintainable code

### 6. Documentation
- **Organized screenshots** in separate `screenshots/` folder with descriptive names
- **Created comprehensive README.md** documenting all steps and commands
- **Structured project folder** for easy review and replication
- **Completed learning journal** with reflections and lessons learned

## üí° What I Learned

### Technical Concepts

#### 1. Virtual Environments Are Essential
- **Isolation:** Each project can have different package versions without conflicts
- **Reproducibility:** pyproject.toml ensures anyone can recreate the exact environment
- **Cleanliness:** Global Python installation stays clean and minimal
- **Best Practice:** Always activate environment before installing packages

#### 2. Pure `uv` Workflow vs Hybrid `uv pip` Approach
- **Pure uv (Recommended):**
  - `uv init --bare` ‚Äî Creates pyproject.toml
  - `uv add <package>` ‚Äî Installs and auto-updates dependencies
  - No manual pip freeze needed
  - Industry standard approach
- **Hybrid uv pip (Old way):**
  - `uv pip install <package>` ‚Äî Just a faster pip
  - `uv pip freeze > requirements.txt` ‚Äî Manual tracking
  - Missing out on uv's full potential
- **Key Insight:** "If you're using uv pip, why install uv at all?" - Mentor feedback

#### 3. `pyproject.toml` vs `requirements.txt`
- **pyproject.toml advantages:**
  - Includes project metadata (name, version, Python version)
  - Industry standard for Python projects
  - Auto-updated by `uv add`
  - More informative and structured
- **requirements.txt:**
  - Legacy approach
  - Just a flat list of packages
  - Requires manual pip freeze
  - Still works, but outdated

#### 4. Modern Python Tooling - `uv` Capabilities
- **Speed Advantage:** `uv` is 10-100x faster than pip for package installation
- **Better Dependency Resolution:** More intelligent handling of package conflicts
- **Auto-detection:** No need to activate when using uv commands
- **Modern Standard:** Industry is moving toward faster, more reliable tools

#### 5. Windows PowerShell Challenges
- **Execution Policy:** PowerShell blocks script execution by default for security
  - Solution: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
  - Alternative: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File script.ps1`
- **Path Separators:** Windows uses backslashes `\` vs Unix forward slashes `/`
- **Activation Scripts:** Different from Unix (`.ps1` vs `.sh`)

#### 4. Python Package Ecosystem
- **Dependencies:** Installing one package often installs many dependencies
  - Example: ipython requires 15 additional packages (colorama, jedi, pygments, etc.)
- **Version Pinning:** `requirements.txt` locks exact versions (e.g., `ipython==9.6.0`)
- **Transitive Dependencies:** Understanding the full dependency tree is important

#### 5. Testing and Verification
- **Import Testing:** Verify packages are accessible before using in projects
- **Simple Tests:** Direct imports are clearer than complex importlib usage
- **Multiple Scenarios:** Test edge cases (zero, negative numbers, large values)

## üöß Challenges I Faced

### Challenge 1: PowerShell Execution Policy Error
**Problem:** When trying to activate virtual environment, got error:
```
cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system
```

**Solution:** Changed execution policy to allow local scripts:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

**Learning:** Windows security settings can block legitimate development tasks. Understanding execution policies is crucial for Windows Python development.

---

### Challenge 2: Understanding Virtual Environment Activation
**Problem:** Initially confused about when to activate environment and why it matters.

**Solution:** Learned that:
- Activation modifies PATH to use environment's Python and packages
- Without activation, packages install to global Python (bad practice)
- Each terminal session needs activation
- Prompt shows `(cf-python-base)` when active

**Learning:** Visual confirmation (prompt change) helps verify environment is active before installing packages.

---

### Challenge 3: Understanding Pure `uv` Workflow vs Hybrid Approach
**Problem:** Initially used `uv pip install` (hybrid approach). Mentor asked: "If you're using uv pip, why install uv at all?"

**Solution:** 
- Researched pure uv workflow
- Learned `uv init --bare` creates pyproject.toml
- Discovered `uv add` installs packages AND updates dependencies automatically
- Reimplemented Exercise 1.1 using pure uv commands
- Understood the difference:
  - ‚ùå `uv pip install` = Just faster pip (missing uv benefits)
  - ‚úÖ `uv add` = Full uv power (auto dependency management)

**Learning:** Using a tool's subset features defeats the purpose. Pure `uv` workflow eliminates manual `pip freeze` and uses industry-standard `pyproject.toml`. Starting with hybrid approach was helpful for transition, but pure uv is the goal.

---

### Challenge 4: Understanding `pyproject.toml` vs `requirements.txt`
**Problem:** Didn't understand why pyproject.toml is better than requirements.txt.

**Solution:** Realized that:
- requirements.txt is just a flat list of packages
- pyproject.toml includes project metadata (name, version, Python version)
- `uv add` auto-updates pyproject.toml (no manual freeze needed)
- pyproject.toml is the modern Python standard
- requirements.txt is legacy but still widely used

**Learning:** Automation (freeze) is more reliable than manual documentation. Exact version tracking prevents subtle bugs from version mismatches.

---

### Challenge 5: Testing the `add.py` Script
**Problem:** First version didn't handle invalid input (non-numeric strings).

**Solution:** 
- Added input validation in test file
- Kept main script simple per mentor instructions
- Learned that production code needs error handling, but learning exercises can focus on core concepts

**Learning:** Balance between robust production code and clear learning examples. Sometimes simplicity aids understanding.

## üîç Key Takeaways

1. **Virtual Environments Are Not Optional** - They're a fundamental best practice in Python development, not an advanced feature.

2. **Pure `uv` workflow is superior to hybrid approach** - Using `uv pip` defeats the purpose of installing uv. Use `uv add` for full benefits.

3. **`pyproject.toml` is the modern standard** - requirements.txt is legacy. Industry has moved to more informative, auto-managed dependency files.

4. **Tool Evolution** - Python ecosystem constantly improves. New tools like `uv` offer significant advantages over older approaches.

5. **Documentation Matters** - Well-organized screenshots and README files make projects professional and easy to review.

6. **Reproducibility is Critical** - pyproject.toml and uv.lock ensure anyone can recreate your exact environment anywhere.

7. **Platform Awareness** - Windows development has unique challenges (execution policies, path separators) that Unix-based tutorials may not cover.

8. **Mentor Feedback is Invaluable** - Recommendations about pure uv workflow, simplified tests, and better organization immediately improved my work quality and understanding.

**What Went Well:**
- Screenshots organization praised as "clean and easy to review"
- Using `uv` recognized as good choice
- README.md documentation appreciated
- Test file implementation noted positively

**Required Action Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Learning journal for Exercise 1.1 now complete (October 16, 2025)

**Recommendations - ALL IMPLEMENTED! ‚úÖ**
- ‚úÖ Transitioned to full `uv` workflow (done October 16, 2025)
- ‚úÖ Used `uv init --bare` to create `pyproject.toml`
- ‚úÖ Practiced `uv add` instead of `uv pip install`
- ‚úÖ Understood automatic environment detection with uv
- ‚úÖ Compared `pyproject.toml` vs `requirements.txt` in real scenario

**What I Did After Feedback:**
1. Reimplemented Exercise 1.1 using pure uv workflow
2. Created pyproject.toml with `uv init --bare`
3. Installed packages with `uv add ipython` and `uv add bcrypt`
4. Created second environment and installed from pyproject.toml
5. Updated README.md to document pure uv commands
