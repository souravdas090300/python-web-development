# Learning Journey: Django Recipe App

This exercise helped me understand:

- How to design a relational database schema for a real-world application
- The process of creating multiple Django apps and linking them via ForeignKey relationships
- How to resolve migration and model errors (reverse accessor clashes, default values)
- The importance of organizing code and removing unused files for maintainability
- How to use Django admin for data entry and management
- Writing and running tests to validate model logic

I gained confidence in:
- Using Djangoâ€™s app structure for modular development
- Debugging and iterating on model definitions
- Managing migrations and database changes
- Documenting my work for future reference
