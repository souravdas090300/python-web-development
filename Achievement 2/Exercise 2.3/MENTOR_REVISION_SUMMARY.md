## Revision Date: October 25, 2025

## âœ… REQUIRED Items Addressed

### 1. Database Schema Diagram (recipe-app-schema.jpg)
**Mentor Requirement:** "The recipe-app-schema.jpg screenshot should contain the database blueprint drawn either on paper or using a free online tool. Research a tool you can use to draw UML class diagrams."

**Status:** Instructions provided âœ“

**Action for Student:**
- Visit https://dbdiagram.io or https://app.diagrams.net (draw.io)
- Create UML class diagram showing:
  ```
  Recipe
  --------
  - id (Primary Key)
  - name (CharField, max 120)
  - cooking_time (PositiveIntegerField)
  - ingredients (TextField, comma-separated)
  - description (TextField)
  --------
  + ingredients_list() -> list
  + difficulty() -> str
  ```
- Export and save as `screenshots/recipe-app-schema.jpg`

---

### 2. Add Five Recipes with Screenshot
**Mentor Requirement:** "Add at least five recipes into your database from the admin site and take a screenshot"

**Status:** Admin configured, ready for data entry âœ“

**Action for Student:**
1. Start server: `python manage.py runserver`
2. Access admin: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
3. Add at least 5 recipes with varied data:
   - Example 1: Easy Salad (5 min, lettuce, tomato, cucumber)
   - Example 2: Spaghetti Carbonara (20 min, pasta, eggs, bacon, parmesan, pepper)
   - Example 3: Scrambled Eggs (5 min, eggs, butter, salt, milk, pepper)
   - Example 4: Chicken Soup (45 min, chicken, carrots, celery)
   - Example 5: Pancakes (15 min, flour, eggs, milk, sugar, butter, baking powder)
4. Take screenshot showing all 5 recipes in admin list view
5. Save as `screenshots/admin-recipes.jpg`

**Admin Features:**
- Shows recipe name, cooking time, and computed difficulty
- Searchable and filterable

## âœ… RECOMMENDATIONS Implemented

### 1. Maintain Just One App âœ“
**Mentor Recommendation:** "Try to be as simple as possible. I'll recommend you maintain just one app. Recipe. Where the Recipe will handle everything related to the recipe."

**Implementation:**
- âœ… Removed `recipe_categories` app
- âœ… Removed `recipe_ingredients` app
- âœ… Consolidated everything into single `recipes` app
- âœ… Updated `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings

**Before:** 3 apps (recipes, recipe_categories, recipe_ingredients)  
**After:** 1 app (recipes)

---

### 2. Simple Model Design with Comma-Separated Ingredients âœ“
**Mentor Recommendation:** "Re-structure your models so that it reflects a simple design. The ingredients field should accept a comma-separated string like salt, water."

**Implementation:**
- âœ… Changed `ingredients` from ManyToManyField to TextField
- âœ… Accepts comma-separated strings: `"salt, water, sugar"`
- âœ… Added helper method `ingredients_list()` to parse as list
- âœ… Removed complex foreign key relationships

**Recipe Model:**
```python
class Recipe(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=120)
    cooking_time = models.PositiveIntegerField(help_text='in minutes')
    ingredients = models.TextField(help_text='Comma-separated list of ingredients')
    description = models.TextField(blank=True)
    
    def ingredients_list(self) -> list[str]:
        """Return ingredients as normalized list."""
        if not self.ingredients:
            return []
        return [item.strip() for item in self.ingredients.split(',') if item.strip()]
    
    def difficulty(self) -> str:
        """Compute difficulty dynamically."""
        num_ingredients = len(self.ingredients_list())
        if self.cooking_time < 10 and num_ingredients < 4:
            return 'Easy'
        if self.cooking_time < 10 and num_ingredients >= 4:
            return 'Medium'
        if self.cooking_time >= 10 and num_ingredients < 4:
            return 'Intermediate'
        return 'Hard'
```

**Benefits:**
- Much simpler to use
- No complex joins needed
- Easy to add/edit ingredients
- Difficulty computed on-the-fly (not stored)

---

### 3. Test Screenshot Named "Test-Report" âœ“
**Mentor Recommendation:** "Name your test screenshot Test-Report."

**Implementation:**
- âœ… Created comprehensive test suite (10 tests)
- âœ… All tests passing
- âœ… Instructions provided in `screenshots/README.txt`

**Action for Student:**
1. Run: `python manage.py test`
2. Take screenshot showing test results
3. Save as `screenshots/Test-Report.jpg` (or .png)

**Test Coverage:**
- Recipe creation âœ“
- Ingredients list parsing âœ“
- Difficulty calculation (all 4 levels) âœ“
- String representation âœ“
- Edge cases (empty, whitespace) âœ“

---

## ðŸ†• BONUS: Two Environments Created

**Implementation:**
Created separate local and production environments per Django best practices:

### Local Environment (`a2-e23-local`)
- Settings: `recipestore/settings_local.py`
- DEBUG = True
- SQLite database
- No host restrictions

### Production Environment (`a2-e23-prod`)
- Settings: `recipestore/settings_prod.py`
- DEBUG = False
- ALLOWED_HOSTS configured
- Production-ready settings

**Documentation:**
- `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
- `README.md` - Project overview and instructions
- Both venvs added to `.gitignore` âœ“

---
