# Exercise 2.2 Learning Journal

## Introduction
Welcome back! Last Exercise, you set up your system and installed Django in a virtual environment. You’ll begin this Exercise by taking a deep dive into some important Django terminology. Then you’ll learn about how a Django project is structured and about how various parts of a project interact.

During this Exercise you'll get your first hands-on experience of creating a Django project. To be more specific, you’ll create the project structure for an application that will be used by a (hypothetical) bookstore. This Bookstore application will ultimately provide information on books, sales, customers, salespeople, and much more. You’ll revisit this application throughout the whole Achievement, to guide you through the ins and outs of Django.

A Django project’s initial set up process allows you to auto-generate code that will establish the Django project structure. The whole process is quite simple, which is one of the great perks of Django. Afterwards, you’ll also be running the Django server and creating a superuser (for admin access). Finally, in the Exercise task, you’ll apply the lessons and skills learned here to your Achievement project—the Recipe application.

## Key Learnings
- Django terminology: project, app, configuration files, database
- Project structure and interactions
- Creating and running Django projects and apps
- Using Django admin and superuser
- Importance of modularity and reusability

## Steps Completed
- Created A2_Recipe_App folder and virtual environment
- Installed Django and created project structure
- Renamed project directory to src
- Ran migrations and started server
- Created superuser and accessed admin dashboard
- Uploaded project and screenshots to GitHub

## Reflections
This exercise provided a strong foundation in Django project setup and management. The hands-on steps clarified the relationship between projects and apps, and highlighted the value of Django’s admin interface for managing users and data. Following mentor instructions step-by-step ensured reproducibility and best practices.
